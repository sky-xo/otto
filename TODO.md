- [ ] Option to show branches from ALL projects, not just the project we're running june in
- [ ] Create a consistent color palette for the UI (centralize colors used for borders, indicators, etc.)
- [ ] Character-level diff highlighting within changed lines (show specific changes, not just whole line)
- [ ] Full-width background - extend red/green background to right edge of panel

# Bugs
