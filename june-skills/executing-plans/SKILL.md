# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: The parent task ID should be provided by the user or found in the plan handoff (e.g., 'Tasks created: t-xxxx'). Read tasks with `june task list <parent-id> --json` and proceed.

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress: `june task update <task-id> --status in_progress`
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed: `june task update <task-id> --status closed --note "Verified"`

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## Resuming After Compaction

If context was compacted, check task state:

```bash
june task list <parent-id>
```

Output shows:

```
t-a3f8  "Implement feature"  [in_progress]
  t-7bc2  "Add middleware"   [closed]
  t-9de1  "Write tests"      [in_progress]  ← resume here
  t-3fg5  "Update docs"      [open]
```

Find the first task with status `open` or `in_progress` and resume from there.

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
